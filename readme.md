# Maya Yaxchilan Object Outlines 

## Description 
A vertically mounted display is mounted in a tombstone. The display shows a photograph of the stone carving, Lintel 24. 
Visitors can cross-fade back and forth between the photo of the object and a line drawing of the object using two arrow buttons. 
The arrow buttons point to the right and the left. The left button is labeled with the text "photograph." 
The right button is labeled with the text "line drawing." A second display operates exactly the same, showing Lintel 25.
